    <h2>About RateMyDorm:</h2>
    <h3>Our mission:</h3>
    <p>Our top priority students get into adequate rooming situations. This site offers the information required to meet the specific needs some students have. RateMyDorms also lets Sewanee students complain about dorms for cathartic purposes or compliment them in gratitude for good quality. Dorm proctors can also use this site to search for areas of improvement for their dorms.</p>

    <h3>Who we are:</h3>
    <p>Three students. One final project and its deadline. Those are the ingredients required to inspire a website such as RateMyDorm. We all met as students of the University of the South, Sewanee. Unfortunately that means there's no backstory from our childhood. However, a common interest in tech brought us to the same place. Clearly, because of the excellent quality and functionality of RateMyDorm, we made an A+ on the final project (needs verification).</p>
