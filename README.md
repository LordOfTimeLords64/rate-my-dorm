# rate-my-dorm
 Rate My Dorm is my final project for CSCI 284 (Database Design with Web Applications). It was a website that allowed students to rate dorms at the University of the South (Sewanee). Users can create an account to rate dorms, ask and answer questions about dorms, and provide comments about their ratings.
